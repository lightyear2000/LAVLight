LAV Light Filters - Stripped-down version of the great LAVFilters codec pack by Hendrik Leppkes
                    Removed audio codecs EAC3 and TrueHD 
 
LAV Filters are a set of DirectShow filters based on the libavformat and libavcodec libraries
from the ffmpeg project, which will allow you to play virtually any format in a DirectShow player.

The light version has reduced codec support. The main purpose is to learn how to compile ffmpeg and adapt the LAVFilters source code.   

Install
=============================
- Unpack
- Register (install_*.bat files)
	Registering requires administrative rights.
	On Vista/7 also make sure to start it in an elevated shell.

Compiling
=============================
Compiling is pretty straight forward using VC++2015 U1 (included project files).
Older versions of Visual Studio are not supported.
